## Learning Opengl

In this project we try to build small room with opengl. we build some object like a table,fan,bed, wardrobe, and the room itself. as addtional we give a point lighting from top of the room that can switch on/off with [space] so we can give some example while the room has a lighting and not. for the object, we try to build it from the cube, so after that we change it to some object that we want like a table and bed with additional texture.
